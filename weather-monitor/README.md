*Real-Time Weather Monitoring System**
**Project Overview**
The Real-Time Weather Monitoring System is designed to gather, store, and visualize real-time weather data from multiple cities. It uses APIs to fetch weather data, stores it in a database, and generates summaries, including alerts and visualizations. This project is ideal for monitoring weather conditions across cities and generating useful insights for decision-making or reporting.

Features
Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities.
Stores the weather data in a local SQLite database.
Generates daily summaries, including average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.
Visualizes weather trends using matplotlib.
Sends email alerts when temperature thresholds are met.
Automatically schedules data fetches at regular intervals using schedule.

Dependencies
requests: For fetching data from weather APIs.
matplotlib: For visualizing weather data.
sqlalchemy: For database interactions.
schedule: For scheduling regular data fetch operations.
smtplib: For sending email alerts (in-built in Python).
To install the required packages, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Python 3.10 or higher
SQLite (optional, if you want to inspect the database manually)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Gurusuresh/weather-monitor.git
cd weather-monitor
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure your settings:

Edit config.py to add your OpenWeatherMap API key and set email configurations if you want to enable alerts.

python
Copy code
API_KEY = 'your_openweathermap_api_key'
DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///weather_data.db'
EMAIL_SENDER = 'your_email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_RECEIVER = 'receiver_email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_email_password'
Run the application:

To fetch and store weather data:

bash
Copy code
python weather_monitor.py
The script will fetch data for predefined cities and store it in the SQLite database. It will also generate weather summaries and visualizations.

Database Structure
The data is stored in an SQLite database (weather_data.db) with the following structure:

Weather Data Table:
id: Primary key
city: Name of the city
temperature: Temperature in Celsius
condition: Weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy)
datetime: Timestamp of data collection
Scheduling Data Fetches
This project uses the schedule library to fetch weather data at regular intervals. You can customize the interval inside weather_monitor.py. By default, it fetches data every 10 minutes:

python
Copy code
schedule.every(10).minutes.do(fetch_weather_data)
Visualization
The project uses matplotlib to plot weather trends for the cities. After running the script, you can view temperature trends and weather conditions over time.

Email Alerts
You can configure the system to send email alerts when specific weather conditions or temperature thresholds are met. For example, you can set it to send an alert if the temperature in a city exceeds 35°C.

Future Enhancements
Add support for more cities dynamically.
Add interactive charts for better data visualization.
Integrate with other weather data sources for richer data.
Implement a web dashboard to visualize weather data in real-time.
